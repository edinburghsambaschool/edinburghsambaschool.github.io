    #### Dance classes

    TESS runs Brazilian dance classes throughout the year on a **Thursday evening from 7.30pm to 8.30pm at Tollcross Community Centre** (Tollcross Primary School). Individual classes cost £5 but you can also buy a 10-class pass for £45, giving you one class free, which is ideal if you plan to attend the classes regularly. Concessions are available for students, so please bring your student card to class.

    Approximately once a month we invite a "miniband" of TESS drummers to play live music in class. This is always a blast, with amazing beats and high energy music and dance. It also gives you an opportunity to become familiar with the band pieces, should you ever join us in performing with the band.

    #### Perform with us

    Dancers who attend the classes regularly and feel confident with the basic steps may be asked to join us in performing. We dance alongside the drummers as part of a gala day parade/festival, or in static performances, such as club gigs. Most performances involve some freestyle dancing as we follow the drumming band and there are also occasions when we dance choreographed routines or steps, either with the band or with recorded music.

    We encourage dancers to create or purchase their own show-stopping samba costumes and headdresses for Samba performances. We have headdresses, skirts and tops which dancers can use for standard gigs and folkloric dances, such as maracatu and Ciranda. We also arrange occasional headdress and costume making workshops for those who want to make their own or contribute to the TESS collection.
