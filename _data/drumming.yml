    #### Street Drumming Courses

    TESS runs street drumming courses throughout the year, with classes beginning in early new year, Easter and Autumn. We aim to introduce different rhythms and songs, as well as technique and getting a feel for what it is like to play in a Samba band.

    The courses cost **£60 for 10 weeks**, which includes a copy of our CD. If you prefer, you can **try the first week for £10** before deciding whether to commit to the full course. We provide all the drums and equipment. There may also be a chance for a busk or performance at the end of the course - show off your new skills to your family and friends.

    #### Joining the main band

    If you enjoy our street drumming course and are interested in joining the main band and performing with us then talk to the teachers on your course. Joining the main band comes with a steep learning curve, so natural ability and a commitment to drumming is vital. Entry to the main band also depends on the requirements of different sections, which change over time.
